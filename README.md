# Fantasy-Sports-points-Prediction
Machine learning based project to predict weekly fantasy points for a Quarterback in NFL

In the past few years, fantasy sports participation in the US and Canada has been exponentially increasing. This fan base extends across age and gender, comprising 19% of all Americans. With such an extensive fan base, the Fantasy Sports industry is booming. Particularly, the Fantasy Football industry has gained a major share of this boom. 

This project aimed at predicting Fantasy points for Fantasy football based on NFL. Quarterback is the most important player on the field of Football. This project aimed at predicting the weekly fantasy points for a team's Quarterback based on his statistical data from the previous weeks and previous seasons. 

Our approach for prediction was using Support Vector Regression(SVR). We trained a support vector regression model using the selective feature data from previous seasons and predicted fantasy points for a Quarterback every week. With this approach, the least Mean Absolute Error(MAE) achieved was around 6 points.

This approach is simple and can be easily extended to other Football positions as well. Also, this approach can be employed for other sports, given that right feature data is selected.
